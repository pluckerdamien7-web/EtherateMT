# By defualt, if a command exits before the timeout duration expires, the exit
# status of the command is returned by timeout.
# 
# By default, if a command exceeds the timeout duration and is killed by timeout
# the exist status 124 is returned by timeout.
# 
# When --preserve-status is used, if a command exits before the timeout duration
# expires, the exit status of the command is returned by timeout.
# 
# When --preserve-status is used, if a command exceeds the timeout duration and
# is killed by timeout, the exist status returned by the command is 128 + N,
# where N is the signal number it received from timeout. Timeout returns this
# exit code. By default timeout sends the SIGTERM signal to the command. SIGTERM
# is signal number 15 (as defined in /usr/include/asm-generic/signal.h), meaning
# the exit code is 143 in this case.
